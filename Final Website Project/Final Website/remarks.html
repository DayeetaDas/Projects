                <h2>STEPS TO SUCCESS:PREPARING FOR THE FAIR:</h2>
                <small>Posted by Dayeeta Das on 23/10/2018</small>
                <p>This is the first time that I attended an Acceler8 skills development session.It proved to be absolutely fruitful.I gained a alot of information about how I should prepare myself before going to a job fair.We were made to do small exercises in groups during the session which gave me information of what questions to ask to an employer,or how to approach them and how to create my contacts with them after the fair.It focussed on how we should dress ourselves before the employers and how to explore the various companies coming to the fair.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>STEPS TO SUCCESS:FINDING WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
                <small>Posted by Dayeeta Das on 23/10/2018</small>
                <p>On this particular session I got to learn various modes in which I can find a job experience.The employability team in the Nottingham trent University provides ample of jobs to the students to get invoved with and enrich their CV's.it also enables them to develop extra curricular skills besides their academics.I also got to interact with people in this session who already have some work experience in various fields.</p>

                <h2>STEPS TO SUCCESS:CV'S AND COVER LETTERS</h2>
                <small>Posted by Dayeeta Das on 25/10/2018</small>
                <p>This session focussed on the style and content of the UK cover letters and CV's and how to write them,which information we should put in them and in which order.it also gave important information on the difference between the CV's and the Cover letters.In this session we were made to do some exercises in small groups in which we had to highlight the important information we needed to include in our CV's.We were also made to choose the ebst CV's and Cover Letters from a bunch given to us and state our reasons for choosing them.This amde the idea clear to us.</p>

                <h2>STEPS TO SUCCESS:USING LINKEDIN</h2>
                <small>Posted by Dayeeta Das on 30/10/2018</small>
                <p>This particular session focussed on developing the personal linkedin accounts of the people who were seeking jobs.It told about the structure of information that the profile must have including the connections that one needed to make and also the kind of picture that the profile should contain and the speaker also mentioned the kind of stuff that we should not upload on the professional profile because the employers looking into it can get the wrong idea.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>STEPS TO SUCESS:POSTGRADUATE STUDY:WHAT,WHY,HOW?</h2>
                <small>Posted by Dayeeta Das on 31/10/2018</small>
                <p>This session provided useful information regarding to the people who are aiming towards post-graduate study.Detailed discussions were made on the personal statement that we need to submit,the fundings and loans that one could take and also how one could repay it back.The session also focussed on why one must/must not indulge in a post-graduate study and also the percentage of post-graduate who are getting employed.We were also given a booklet at the end of the session that includes details on the post-graduate study at the Nottingham Trent University.</p>
