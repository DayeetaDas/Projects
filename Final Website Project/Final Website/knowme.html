                <h1 class="page title">About Myself</h1>
                <p>Hello reader, my name is Dayeeta Das.I am 17 years old and originally from India.
                I am a first year student enrolled for the sandwich course of Computer Science.
                The university has had a profound impact on my life in these few months pf my stay
                here.I have not only been able to cope with the uncertain weather of Northern Europe
                but I have learned to socialize making friends from all corners of the world.The academic
                resources provided by the university along with the scope to engage in various extra-
                curricular activities via the NTSU volunteering or jobshop has made me more confident
                than ever.The Acceler8 sessions have given me a compact knoweldge about the demands 
                of the industry.
                    I hope in the near future I will be able to make a change with all the knowledge that
                I have accumulated  </p>

                    through the Acceler8 and Student's Union.It only allows a student to excel in their academics but
                    also enables them to have vital information on how the industry in their particular field of study
